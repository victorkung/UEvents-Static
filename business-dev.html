			<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>The world is is filled with countless things to explore and experience. But most people are content with doing the same things over and waiting for something to happen to them. We aim to change that by using data to deliver precise personalized event recommendations directly to your fingertips.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>UEvents strives to provide users with personalized event recommendations that provide them with a plethora of exciting options to tap into at any given time.</p>

			<br>
			<p>So how will we ensure that when a user opens up our platform we are able to provide them with a stellar experience - to provide them with stellar event recommendations in a heartbeat?</p>
			<br>
			<br>

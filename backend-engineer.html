			<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>The world is is filled with countless things to explore and experience. But most people are content with doing the same things over and waiting for something to happen to them. We aim to change that by using data to deliver precise personalized event recommendations directly to your fingertips.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>UEvents strives to provide users with personalized event recommendations that provide them with a plethora of exciting options to tap into at any given time. As we expand into more places and take on more users and events, we need to maintain a scalable architecture that successfully stores and manipulates the data we collect.</p>
			<br>
			<p>So how will we ensure that when a user opens up our platform we are able to provide them with a stellar experience - to provide them with stellar event recommendations in a heartbeat?</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><strong>The Role</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p></p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><strong>About You</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>You’re as enthused as we are about fundamentally changing local event discovery and you can't wait to get started.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>You have a passion for working on live projects that impact real people.</b> We care more about experience and enthusiasm than degrees and awards</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Familiarity with MVC frameworks and a willingness to learn new technologies.</b> Our application is built on a Ruby on Rails backend with an AngularJS frontend. You should be prepared to learn what you need to get the job done.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>You are a self-starter.</b> You can take a project and run with it, but also know to ask for help when you’re stumped.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Quality and cleanliness of code matters to you.</b> You understand that taking shortcuts now don't pay off in the long run. While we're certainly not perfect when it comes to adhering to Test-Driven Development, we try and test as much as we can. </p>

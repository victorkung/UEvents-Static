			<p>UEvents is a discovery platform for college students and affiliates to learn about all the events happening on their campus in one centralized location. By compiling event information through social media websites, event-listing websites, and university event calendars, we provide users with the most comprehensive and organized list of campus events available, all on one simple page.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Users can sort events by type and receive event recommendations based on their preferences and past event attendances. In addition, users can see all the events happening at the other universities on our platform, allowing them to tap into our nationwide network of college events.</p>
			<br>

			<p><strong>Team</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>UEvents was founded by Victor Kung and Shaan Sapra, two students at the University of Chicago, who were frustrated at how there was no way for them to know about all the range of events on campus. Tired of missing out on fun events happening around them, they decided to build a platform that enables students to, for the first time, see all campus events in one location.</p>

			<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>College is about meeting new people and sharing unforgettable experiences together. We help students create these long-lasting memories by showing them events both on and off-campus that we think they’ll love.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>Through continually aggregating event information and interacting with our users, we've stored a tremendous amount of data that we are only just beginning to tap into. This treasure trove of opens up vast possibilities for us, providing us with a truly unique business opportunity. How will you help us unlock our business potential?</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><strong>The Role</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Build a company.</b> You will be working alongside the CEO and spearheading the business operations of the team. You'll also have the opportunity to build your own team as we grow.</b></p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Shape our business.</b> As a young startup transitioning from a cool app to a business, we need to nail down our business model to succeed. Help us explore potential financial avenues and to convince us which ones are worth pursuing.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Play a key role in outreach.</b> A big part of success comes from making sure we have the content that users want.  This means that we need to make sure we know about all the best events happening around town and the people running them. Help us source and partner with these individuals.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Wear many hats.</b> There are many things to be done and you'll be dipping your hands in multiple projects at once. From working with the dev team to come up with new features to sourcing potential clients - you will get the authentic startup experience.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><strong>About You</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>You’re as enthused as we are about fundamentally changing local event discovery and you can't wait to get started.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Flexible and fast learner.</b> You're ready to jump right into anything from making cold calls to drafting business plans. You're attentive to detail, yet you're focused on the big picture. You're also able to learn new skills, tools and processes on the go.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Embrace the unknown.</b> You get shit done. You’re also a self-starter - you can take a project and run with it, but also know to ask for help when you’re stumped. You're unfazed and quite frankly, excited, at the challenge of finding creative solutions to difficult problems with limited resources. </p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Organization is your strength.</b> You'll be juggling multiple projects and working across different teams - communication and organization will be your best bet to ensure that all deadlines and milestones are met.</p>

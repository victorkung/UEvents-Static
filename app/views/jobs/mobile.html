   <p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
   <br>
   <p>College is about meeting new people and sharing unforgettable experiences together. We help students create these long-lasting memories by showing them events both on and off-campus that we think they’ll love.</p>

   <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
   <br>
   <p>UEvents strives to provide users with personalized event recommendations that provide them with a plethora of exciting options to tap into at any given time. The popularization of mobile devices opens up a world of possibilites for us to explore. Taking advantage of unique mobile features like push notifications and geo-location, we could take personalization to the next level.</p>

			<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>College is about meeting new people and sharing unforgettable experiences together. We help students create these long-lasting memories by showing them events both on and off-campus that we think they’ll love.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>UEvents strives to provide users with personalized event recommendations that provide them with a plethora of exciting options to tap into at any given time. As we expand into more places and take on more users and events, we need to maintain a scalable architecture that successfully stores and manipulates the data we collect.</p>
			<br>
			<p>So how will we ensure that when a user opens up our platform we are able to provide them with a stellar experience - to provide them with great event recommendations in a heartbeat?</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><strong>The Role</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>Design and build new features from the ground up: Crafting UIs with front-end engineers and building backend systems with Ruby</p>
			<br>
			<p>Practice disciplined software engineering, including automated testing, code reviews, and writing beautiful, pragmatic code.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Apply user testing to collect feedback/metrics and rapidly iterate on product</p>
			<br>
			<p>Be flexible, grow, and learn fast in a startup environment</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><strong>About You</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>You’re as enthused as we are about fundamentally changing local event discovery and you can't wait to get started.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>You have a passion for working on live projects that impact real people.</b> We care more about experience and enthusiasm than degrees and awards</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Familiarity with Git, MVC frameworks and a willingness to learn new technologies.</b> Our technology is built on a Ruby on Rails backend with an AngularJS frontend. You should be prepared to learn what you need to get the job done.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>You are a self-starter.</b> You can take a project and run with it, but also know to ask for help when you’re stumped.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Quality and cleanliness of code matters to you.</b> You understand that taking shortcuts now don't pay off in the long run. </p>

			<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>College is about meeting new people and sharing unforgettable experiences together. We help students create these long-lasting memories by showing them events both on and off-campus that we think they’ll love.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>We created UEvents to tackles a problem we encountered as college students and to deliver a valuable and personalized experience for each individual user. In order to more effectively reach out to our target audience, we need to develop a strong brand identity and to develop marketing strategy. How will you help us stand out from the rest?</p>
			<br>
			<p><em>For our purposes, marketing is defined as any function or process necessary to understand customer needs and then design, deliver, and communicate products and services that meet those needs profitably.</em></p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><strong>The Role</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Build the brand.</b> You will be working alongside the CEO to develop marketing strategies to increase our brand visibility. You'll also have the opportunity to build your own team as we grow.</b></p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Establish an identity.</b> As we continue to expand to other universities and work with event promoters, we need establish uniform structures and style guides to streamline our marketing process and to make sure that everything we send out is uniquely UEvents.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Own our user relationships.</b> As a startup focused on user-growth and retention, we need to make sure that all of our interactions with users are generating positive outcomes. This can include our email newsletters, social media presence and anything else you can think of!</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Wear many hats.</b> There are many things to be done and you'll be dipping your hands in multiple projects at once. From working with the dev team to A/B test email campaigns to generating social media buzz - you will get the authentic startup experience.</p>
			<br>
			<br>

			<p><strong>About You</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>You’re as enthused as we are about fundamentally changing local event discovery and you can't wait to get started.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>You care about all things "people".</b> What is the impact of every decision we make, and how can we tweak our existing processes to positively and profitably influence user behavior?</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Eye for design.</b> You understand that good design is not just about what's visually appealing - there's a reason behind every design choice and the desired impact. You're attentive to detail, yet you're focused on the big picture.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Embrace the unknown.</b> You get shit done. You’re also a self-starter - you can take a project and run with it, but also know to ask for help when you’re stumped. You're unfazed and quite frankly, excited, at the challenge of finding creative solutions to difficult problems with limited resources. </p>
			<br>
			<p><b>Organization is your strength.</b> You'll be juggling multiple projects and working across different teams - communication and organization will be your best bet to ensure that all deadlines and milestones are met.</p>
